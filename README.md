## About:

I noticed from speaking with many of my female friends that sexual assault has become a very common occurence. As 
a man, I've never had to worry about walking through a parking garage to the elevator, but I realize that this is a 
reality for many of my friends. I intend to have a safe place for people from all
walks of life to share their stories of rape or sexual assault. With the intensity of the stories, this will not be a 
site for children. Instead, it serves the purpose of being blatantly powerful with the potential to create or
change current legislature for the protection of victims of sexual abuse or rape.
